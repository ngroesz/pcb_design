## Pixart camera
The turret board requires a Pixart camera. This component cannot be purchased off-the-shelf. Others pioneered the reusage of this module and plenty of documentation exists on the Internet. The camera modules are sourced from Wii Remotes, which can still (as of 2021) be sourced from eBay for fairly cheap. Search for "Wii Remote For Parts". They can be found individually or in lots, they shouldn't be much more than $5/controller. Make sure they are original Wii Remotes, not third-party copies nor "Wii Motion Plus". The camera module is fairly easy to desolder, though take care to not pull the contacts from the module when removing from the board. There are a couple other cool bits on a Wii Remote board, including a vibration motor and a beefy capacitor. These days, though I tend to just pull the camera module and throw away the rest.
